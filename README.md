# SkyPlanX
This browser userscript saves a SkyVector flight plan to a .pln file so it can be imported into FSX.

To install this userscript, you will need a userscript manager.  I recommend getting either Tampermonkey (Chrome, Opera, Safari), or Greasemonkey (Firefox).

# Installation

Simply drag the user.js file into a browser window.  Your userscript manager should prompt you to install the userscript.

# Usage

When you load SkyVector, a link will appear on the top toolbar saying "Export Flight Plan".  Once you have created your route, you can export the .pln file onto your computer.  To load it into FSX, navigate to "Flight Planner" and then "Load..." to select the file.

SkyPlanX has been tested only in FSX Steam Edition, but may also work with FSX Classic and P3D.
